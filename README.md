# Project3 : Bank Marketing

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) using this dataset.

Conclusion:

Based on accuracy for training and test data, we gound that SVC model outperformed all other models.

Here is the final results:


model	  train_score	  test_score
KNN      	90%	          80%
Logistic 	84%	          83%
Tree	    100%	        80%
SVC	      89%	          84%
